        Hi there! My name is Nihaal Prasad, and I'm the author of this blog. I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science at George Mason University, and my goal is to pursue a career in cybersecurity. This blog is essentially just a place where I post some of the small projects that I have been messing around with. I created this little website in order to consolidate some of the things that I have learned in the past and to keep track of some of the projects that I've done. I hope you have fun reading it.
