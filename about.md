        Like most other people who are in the IT field, most of my knowledge about computer science comes from me just messing around with technology. I first started learning how to code my own programs when I was eleven, and since then, I've been trying to learn as much as possible about computer systems, sometimes spending hours writing/analyzing code or tinkering with computers to make them do interesting things.

        My name is Nihaal Prasad, and I'm the author of this blog. I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at George Mason University, and I hope to pursue a career in cybersecurity. This blog is essentially just a place where I post some of the small projects that I have been messing around with. I created this little website in order to consolidate some of the things that I have learned in the past, to help other people who might be a little bit newer to this field, and to keep track of some of the projects that I've done. I hope you guys enjoy reading it. (:
