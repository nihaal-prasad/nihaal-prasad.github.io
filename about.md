        If you need someone who has a passion for problem solving and logic, then I'm your man. Like most other people who are in the IT field, most of my knowledge about computer science comes from me just messing around with technology. I first started learning how to code my own programs when I was eleven, and since then, I've been trying to learn as much as possible about computer systems, sometimes spending hours writing/analyzing code or tinkering with computers to make them do interesting things.

        My name is Nihaal Prasad, and I'm the author of this blog. I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science at George Mason University, and I hope to pursue a career in IT. This blog is essentially just a place where I post some of the small projects that I have been working on. I created this little website in order to consolidate some of the things that I have learned in the past, to help other people who might be a little bit newer to this field, and to keep track of some of the projects that I've done. I hope you guys enjoy reading it. (:

        At the moment, I am currently working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at George Mason University. At my current job, I am mentoring and coaching 443 undergraduate students in basic object oriented programming techniques and providing technical Q+A support for them.
